Algorithm: Kernelized Support Vector Machine Regressor

Computes an optimized best fit line for a linear or non-linear dataset, as well
as a corresponding set of margins that surround as many training instances as
possible, based on the regularization parameter C. Supports both hard margin
and soft margin regression. Supports polynomial regression through use of
polynomial kernel function.

Parameters:

C - regularization parameter that determines the amount of error tolerated
during optimization

sigma - regularization parameter that determines how wide the corresponding set
of margins will be during optimization

kernel - boolean value, determines whether the data being optimized is
linear or non-linear, and whether to use the linear or polynomial kernel
function

degree - determines to what degree the polynomial kernel should be calculated

Methods:

linear kernel - computes linear kernel for a linear dataset

polynomial kernel - computes a polynomial kernel to allow algorithm to optimize
parameters for a non-linear dataset

get_params - uses the Python quadratic programming library CVXOPT to solve the
support vector machine quadratic programming optimization problem, based on the
training data and user-defined regularization parameters

train - optimizes the support vector machine's parameters based on training
dataset and regularization parameters

predict - predicts values for new instances once support vector machine
parameters have been optimized
