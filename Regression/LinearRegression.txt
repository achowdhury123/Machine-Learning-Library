Algorithm: Linear Regression

Computes an optimized weighted sum of input features. Supports 2nd degree
polynomial regression for non-linear datasets.


Parameters:

n_features - the number of features in the input set

polynomial - boolean value, determines whether the data being optimized is
linear or non-linear

degree - the degree to which polynomial features should be added; polyfit
function currently supports adding 2nd degree polynomial features


Methods:

polyfit - adds polynomial features to a dataset

train - optimizes linear regression parameters based on training dataset,
learning rate, and number of iterations; uses randomized, mini-batch gradient
descent, where batch_size is the size of each training batch

predict - predicts values for new instances once linear regression parameters
have been optimized
