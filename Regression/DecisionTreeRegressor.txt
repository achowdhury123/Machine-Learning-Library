Algorithm: Decision Tree Regressor

Builds a tree structure consisting of nodes, with each node representing a
decision boundary learned from the training data. New instances traverse the
decision boundaries until they arrive at a leaf, at which point their
corresponding value is computed.

Parameters:

max_depth - the maximum amount of levels in the tree that will be built

min_samples_per_leaf - the minimum amount of samples that can be in a leaf
before it can be split

random - boolean value, determines whether the tree will be trained on the
entire dataset if false, or if it will be trained on a random subset of the
dataset if true

random_features - the size of the random subset chosen from the training
dataset if random is set to true

Methods:

get_average - computes the average of a training set

MSE - computes the mean squared error of a training set

CARTCost - uses the CARTCost algorithm to recursively calculate the optimized
decision boundaries for the training dataset and build the tree structure based
off of the calculated decision boundary values

train - calls the CARTCost algorithm

predict_value - recursively traverses the optimized decision tree to predict
the value for a single instance

predict - calls predict_value function for multiple instances
