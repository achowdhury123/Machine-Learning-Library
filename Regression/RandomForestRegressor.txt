Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Uses multiple randomized decision trees to create an ensemble method for
regression. Uses Python's multiprocessing library to optimize performance time.

Parameters:

decision_trees - the number of decision trees to grow in the forest

max_depth - the maximum amount of levels in the tree that will be built

min_samples_per_leaf - the minimum amount of samples that can be in a leaf
before it can be split

Methods:

train - optimizes the trees in the random forest

predict - uses the optimized random forest to predict values for new instances
