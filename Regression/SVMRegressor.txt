Algorithm: Support Vector Machine Regressor

Computes an optimized best fit line for a linear dataset, as well as a
corresponding set of margins that surround as many training instances as
possible, based on the regularization parameter C. Supports both hard  margin and soft
margin regression.

Parameters:

C - regularization parameter that determines the amount of error tolerated
during optimization

sigma - regularization parameter that determines how wide the corresponding set
of margins will be during optimization

Methods:

get_params - uses the Python quadratic programming library CVXOPT to solve the
support vector machine quadratic programming optimization problem, based on the
training data and user-defined regularization parameters

train - optimizes the support vector machine's parameters based on training
dataset and regularization parameters

predict - predicts values for new instances once support vector machine
parameters have been optimized
