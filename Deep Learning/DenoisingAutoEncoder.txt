Algorithm: Denoising AutoEncoder

Creates a Denoising AutoEncoder using a fully connected architecture, implemented in TensorFlow.

Parameters:

hidden_layer_list - list containing the user-defined denoising autoencoder architecture, where the first element in the list is the number of nodes in the denoising autoencoder's input layer and the last element in the list is the number of nodes in the denoising autoencoder's output layer

The following example defines a denoising autoencoder containing an input layer, 3 hidden layers, and an output layer:

hidden_layer_list = [100, 50, 25, 50, 100]

Methods:

train - initializes the TensorFlow variables defined by the denoising autoencoder's hidden layer list, trains them using the given optimizer, and saves the model

predict - restores the model parameters defined when the train method was called, and uses them to remove noise from new instances
