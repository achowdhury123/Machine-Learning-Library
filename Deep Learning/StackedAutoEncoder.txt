Algorithm: Stacked AutoEncoder

Creates a Stacked AutoEncoder using a fully connected architecture, implemented in TensorFlow.

Parameters:

hidden_layer_list - list containing the user-defined stacked autoencoder architecture, where the first element in the list is the number of nodes in the stacked autoencoder's input layer and the last element in the list is the number of nodes in the stacked autoencoder's output layer

The following example defines a stacked autoencoder containing an input layer, 3 hidden layers, and an output layer:

hidden_layer_list = [100, 50, 25, 50, 100]

Methods:

train - initializes the TensorFlow variables defined by the stacked autoencoder's hidden layer list, trains them using the given optimizer, and saves the model

predict - restores the model parameters defined when the train method was called, and returns the output of the stacked autoencoder's coding layer for new instances
