Algorithm: Kernelized Support Vector Machine Classification

Computes an optimized classification boundary for a linear or non-linear
dataset, as well as a corresponding set of margins that form a boundary from as
many training instances as possible, based on the regularization parameter C.
Supports both hard margin and soft margin classification. Supports polynomial
classification through use of polynomial kernel function.

Parameters:

C - regularization parameter that determines the amount of error tolerated
during optimization

kernel - boolean value, determines whether the data being optimized is
linear or non-linear, and whether to use the linear or polynomial kernel
function

degree - determines to what degree the polynomial kernel should be calculated

Methods:

linear kernel - computes linear kernel for a linear dataset

polynomial kernel - computes a polynomial kernel to allow algorithm to optimize
parameters for a non-linear dataset

get_params - uses the Python quadratic programming library CVXOPT to solve the
support vector machine quadratic programming optimization problem, based on the
training data and user-defined regularization parameters

train - optimizes the support vector machine's parameters based on training
dataset and regularization parameters

predict - predicts class values for new instances once support vector machine
parameters have been optimized
