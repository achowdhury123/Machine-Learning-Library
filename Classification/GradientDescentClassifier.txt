Algorithm: Gradient Descent Classifier

Computes an optimized best fit line for a linear dataset, as well as a
corresponding set of margins that surround as many training instances as
possible, based on the regularization parameter C. Supports both hard margin
and soft margin regression.

Parameters:

C - regularization parameter that determines the amount of error tolerated
during optimization

Methods:

train - optimizes the support vector machine's parameters based on training
dataset and regularization parameters; uses randomized, mini-batch gradient
descent, where batch_size is the size of each training batch

predict - predicts values for new instances once support vector machine
parameters have been optimized
