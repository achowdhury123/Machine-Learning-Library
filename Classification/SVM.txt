Algorithm: Support Vector Machine Classifier

Computes an optimized classification boundary for a linear dataset, as well as
a corresponding set of margins that form a boundary from as many training
instances as possible, based on the regularization parameter C. Supports both
hard  margin and soft margin classification.

Parameters:

C - regularization parameter that determines the amount of error tolerated
during optimization

Methods:

get_params - uses the Python quadratic programming library CVXOPT to solve the
support vector machine quadratic programming optimization problem, based on the
training data and user-defined regularization parameters

train - optimizes the support vector machine's parameters based on training
dataset and regularization parameters

predict - predicts class values for new instances once support vector machine
parameters have been optimized
