Algorithm: Logistic Classifier

Computes probabilities for input classes. Supports both binary classification
as well as multiclass. Algorithm uses the logistic function for binary
classification and the generalized softmax function for multiclass
classification.

Parameters:

n_features - the number of features in the input set

multi_class - boolean value that determines whether the classification will be
binary when false or multiclass when true

classes - the number of classes in the training dataset when multi_class is set
to true

Methods:

logit - computes the logistic function value for the instances in a dataset

softmax - computes the softmax score for the instances in a dataset

train - optimizes logistic classification parameters based on training dataset,
learning rate, and number of iterations; uses randomized, mini-batch gradient
descent, where batch_size is the size of each training batch

predict - predicts classifications for new instances once logistic
classification parameters have been optimized

predict_proba - predicts the probabilities that new instances belong to each
class once logistic classification parameters have been optimized
